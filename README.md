## input

    This folder contains all the essential information required to design the package.

## Questions


    1. VCAP - Do we need to connect this pin? Presently there is no connection to this pin : PIN 24
        
        [ Core voltage regulator filter capacitor connection ]

    2. VUSB3V3 is not connected ( Is it okay to leave it unconnected ? ) : PIN 29

## Note:

    1. PIN 19, 23, 25, 40 -> These 4 pins has no connection ( according to the datasheet )
    2. We have 36 operating PINS

## 5V Tolerance:

    - All hardware SPI pins are 5 volt tolerant
    - All shared pins are 5 Volt Tolerant
    - All hardware I2C pins are 5 Volt Tolerant
